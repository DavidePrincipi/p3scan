--ripMIME 1.3.x----------TO DO LIST---------------
- 16 July 2003
	- Make ripMIME work with memory streams rather than files.


- 16 March 2003
	- Create a way for users to explicitly define what filename the contents of
		the 'blankzone' will be saved to, rather than [typically] textfile0.

	- Move all decoding operations ( UUdecode, BASE64 ) into a library called libmime-decoders

--ripMIME 1.2.x----------TO DO LIST---------------

This list is for anyone who wishes to help out with the ripMIME
development, and is wondering what there needs to be done.

I'm always looking out for mailpacks which fail to extract
correctly with ripMIME.  Send them along to mailpacks@pldaniels.com
gzip'd or bzip2'd. 

Don't forget to describe what aspect about the mailpack is not unpacking
correctly, otherwise I might try the mailpack and see all the files come
out and think that there's nothing wrong.

Regards.
