The ripMIME[1] library is only needed if your virus scanner
cannot natively process email messages (for example: FRISK F-Prot).

You can now compile p3scan without the ripmime library:

in p3scan.h:138, change #define DEMIME to #undef DEMIME and then
in the source directory, rm Makefile and then:
ln -sf Makefile-noripmime Makefile
